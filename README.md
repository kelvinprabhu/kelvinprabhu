Welcome to my corner of the internet, where bugs fear to tread and code comes alive... usually after several attempts. 😅

---

### 👀 What am I interested in? 
- **AI & ML** – Teaching machines to be smarter than my microwave.
- **Web Development** – Making buttons click and pages load (most of the time, anyway).
- **Astrophysics** – Space is cool and all, but mostly I just want to know where the aliens are. 👽

---

### 🌱 Currently Learning
- **[Your Tech of Choice]** – Trying to decode these new-fangled technologies (without breaking my IDE).
- **Fancy Tools** – Tinkering with [mention tools like Docker, Kubernetes, etc.], mostly because they make me sound smart.

---

### 💞️ Seeking Partners in Crime (aka Collab Opportunities)
- **Open Source** – If you’re open, I’m open! Let’s throw some code together and see what sticks.
- **Research** – Space nerds, AI enthusiasts, and code adventurers, unite! 🚀

### 📫 Where to Find Me
- **Email**: [kelvinprabhu@example.com](mailto:kelvinprabhu@example.com) – Send me memes... and maybe some serious stuff too.
- **LinkedIn**: [linkedin.com/in/kelvinprabhu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelvinprabhu/) – Professional stuff happens here. Promise.
- **Twitter**: [@kelvinprabhu](https://twitter.com/kelvinprabhu) – Where I occasionally tweet wisdom (or just retweet funny cat videos).

---

### 😄 Pronouns
- He/Him (but you can call me 'Code Ninja' if you like)

---

### ⚡ Fun Fact
I can make a mean cup of coffee and debug code simultaneously... mostly because caffeine is a key part of the debugging process. ☕

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore, grab some popcorn 🍿, and watch me battle it out with code. 👾
